if you want to delete commits without using git reset:
say you have commits A, B, C, D, E but you want to delete D and E.
!!!step 0: check if somewhere in D or E or in your uncommited local changes there is something that you DON'T want to destroy. If that is the case, save it in a safe file in a safe place. 
step 1: git checkout <commit C>  ("you are in detached HEAD etc.") (<good commit> is the first few characters of the commit hash)
step 2: git checkout -b good_branch ("switched to new branch good_branch")
step 3: git branch -m master bad_branch (renames master into bad_branch)
step 4: git branch -m good_branch master
(optional) step 5: git branch -D bad_branch (deletes the bad branch)
(optional) step 6: commit the stuff that you saved in step 0
